GACODE refers to a collection of serial and HPC software developed by the Theory Group at `General Atomics <http://www.ga.com/magnetic-fusion>`_, and distributed through the `GACODE source code repository <https://github.com/gafusion/gacode/>`_ at GitHub. There are numerous :doc:`public installations <setup>` of GACODE (via `AToM <https://scidac.github.io/atom>`_ or local maintainers).  You can also :doc:`install and build <build>` the GACODE suite from sources to run on your desktop or laptop.
