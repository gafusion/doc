.. |ip| replace:: :doc:`input.gacode <input_gacode>`

To see what a sample |ip| looks like, at the command line type

.. code:: bash

	  $ cgyro -g reg14 ; cat reg14/input.gacode

Overview
--------

The file |ip| contains the entire dataset required for specification of experimental profiles. All such profiles are specified on an nexp-point grid.  The information included is sufficient to carry out simulations of strongly-shaped up-down asymmetric (i.e., arbitrary) equilibria using the new :doc:`MXH equilibrium parameters <geometry>` :cite:`arbon:2020`.  

Profile ordering in |ip| is arbitrary and comment lines (starting with ``#`` in the first column) can be added for convenience.  These comment lines are ignored by the parser.  To generate |ip|, please use the ``profiles_gen`` command-line tool.
